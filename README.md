### Abstract

Resurgence of previously suppressed behavior can occur when differential reinforcement is discontinued. Recent research has
investigated strategies to mitigate resurgence, including punishing the target response during alternative reinforcement. A
punishment strategy consisting of reinforcer loss contingent on the target response (response cost) does not appear to attenuate
resurgence, but these effects had not been replicated with other negative-punishment procedures, such as timeouts. This study
investigated effects of timeouts on subsequent resurgence when adults responded to earn points during a computer task. Timeouts
did not affect subsequent resurgence. These findings, in combination with previous research, suggest that negative punishment
may not reduce the likelihood of subsequent resurgence
